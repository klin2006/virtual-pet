Turky Chiken has various states: Full, Happy, and Clean.
Here are the various activities you can do with Turky Chiken:
Throw the kernel
Play tic-tac-toe
Clean the pen
Just chill
Quit

Each state starts at 100.
When you pick an activity, you may increase some aspects of Turky Chiken's states, but you may also decrease others. 

Here is what happens when each activity is picked:
Throw the kernel: Adds 50 to Full, Subtracts 40 from Clean
Play tic-tac-toe: Adds 30 to Happy 
Clean the pen: Subtracts 45 from Happy, Adds 100 to Clean
Just chill: Subtracts 25 from Full, Subtracts 20 from Clean
Quit: Quits the program

If Turky Chiken gets 0's for all states at the same time, you will get this message:
"Turky Chiken has flown the coop" and the program will quit.
